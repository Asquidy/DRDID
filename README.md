# DRDID: Doubly Robust Difference-in-Differences.

## Overview 


This `R` package implements different DID procedures to estimate the ATT under the conditional PTA, including a regression-based DID estimator in the spirit of Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1997), the inverse probabily weigthed (IPW) DID estimator proposed by Abadie (2005), and the different doubly-robust DID estimators proposed
in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019), [Doubly Robust Difference-in-Difference Estimators](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3293315).


On one hand, the regression DID estimator requires the regression model for the evolution of the potential outcomes for the control group to be correctly specified. On the other hand, the IPW DID estimator requires that the conditional probability of being in the treated group (the propensity score) to be correctly specified. By noticing that these DID estimators rely on different, non-nested assumptions, [Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3293315) propose to combine them in a particular way such that the resulting DID estimator remains consistent if either (but not necessarily both) the regression or the propensity score model is correctly specified. In addition, the DR DID estimators proposed by [Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3293315) also attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when both the regression and propensity score models are correctly specified.


As discussed in [Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3293315), a researcher can construct different DR DID estimators depending on how he/she estimates the nuisance functions. The `DRDID` package implements two Doubly-Robust DID estimators when panel data are available, and four Doubly-Robust DID estimators when repeated cross-section data are available:


**PANEL DATA ESTIMATORS**
        
* `drdid_panel` - This implements the "Traditional" DR DID estimator proposed in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019) when panel data are available, where one uses a logistic propensity score model and a linear regression model for the outcome growth of the comparison units. The propensity score parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood, and the outcome regression parameters are estimated using OLS. When both working models are correctly specified, the DR DID estimator is semiparametrically efficient.

* `drdid_imp_panel` - This implements the "further improved" DR DID estimator proposed in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019) when panel data are available. On top of being doubly-robust consistent and locally semiparametrically efficient as the estimator implemented via `drdid_panel`, it is also doubly-robust for inference. We estimate the propensity score parameters using the inverse probability tilting procedure proposed by Graham, Pinto and Egel (2012), and the outcome regression parameters using weighted least squares.


**REPEATED CROSS-SECTION DATA ESTIMATORS**
        
* `drdid_rc` - This implements the "Traditional" DR and locally Efficient DID estimator proposed in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019) when repeated cross-section data are available. This estimator makes use of outcome regressions for both treated and comparison units. Like `drdid_panel`, the propensity score parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood, and the outcome regression model parameters are estimated using OLS. 

* `drdid_rc1` - This implements the "Traditional" DR DID estimator proposed in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019) when repeated cross-section data are available. This estimator makes use of outcome regression only for the comparison units, though it does not attain the semiparametrically efficient bound. Like `drdid_rc`, the propensity score parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood, and the outcome regression model parameters are estimated using OLS. 

* `drdid_imp_rc` - This implements the "further improved" DR and locally Efficient DID estimator proposed in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019) when repeated cross-section data are available. This estimator makes use of outcome regressions for both treated and comparison units. Like `drdid_imp_panel`, the propensity score parameters are estimated using Graham, Pinto and Egel (2012) procedure, and the outcome regression parameters for the comparison units are estimated using weighted least squares. On the other hand, the outcome regression parameters for the comparison units are estimated via OLS.

* `drdid_imp_rc1` - This implements the "further improved" DR DID estimator proposed in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019) when repeated cross-section data are available. This estimator makes use of outcome regression only for the comparison units, though it does not attain the semiparametrically efficient bound. Like `drdid_imp_panel`, the propensity score parameters are estimated using Graham, Pinto and Egel (2012) procedure, and the outcome regression parameters for the comparison units are estimated using weighted least squares.
