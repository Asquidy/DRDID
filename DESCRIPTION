Description: This package implements different Difference-in-Differences (DID) estimators for 
    the ATT when the available data contains two periods, pre and post treatment, and two 
    groups, a treated and a comparison group. The main estimators covered here are the
    locally efficient doubly robust DID estimators proposed by Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020);
    the inverse probability weighted DID estimator proposed by Abadie(2005); and the
    outcome regression DID estimator in the spirit of Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1997). 
    For completeness, the package also implements the DID estimator based on the two-way
    fixed effect linear regression, though such a procedure usually does not recover the 
    average treatment effect on the treated; see e.g. the simulation exercise in Sant'Anna
    and Zhao (2020).
