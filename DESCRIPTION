Description: Difference-in-Difference (DID) methods are among the most widely used tools in
    studying the causal effect of a treatment, intervention, or policy. 
    This package implements different DID procedures to estimate the ATT when the available data contains
    two periods, pre and post treatment, and two groups, a treated and a comparison group. The main estimators covered here are
    (i) the doubly robust and semiparametrically efficient DID estimators developed in 
    Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019) <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3293315>, (ii) the inverse probability weigthed DID
    estimator developed in Abadie(2005) <doi:10.1111/0034-6527.00321>, and (iii) the regression-based DID estimator 
    in the spirit of Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1997) <doi:10.2307/2971733>. For completeness, the package also implements the DID 
    estimator based on the two-way fixed effect linear regression, though such a procedure usually does not recover the average treatment
    effect on the treated; see e.g. the simulation exercise in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2019) <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3293315>.
