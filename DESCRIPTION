Description: This package implements different estimators for the Average Treatment Effect on
    the Treated in Difference-in-Differences (DID) setups where the parallel trends assumption
    holds after you condition on a vector of pre-treatment covariates. The main estimators 
    implemented here are the locally efficient, doubly-robust DID estimators proposed by 
    Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01723>. A number of other DID 
    estimators discussed in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) are also implemented.
